                This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
                A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
                I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
                    <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                    <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
